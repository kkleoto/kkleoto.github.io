                        <h2>My Top 10 Favourite Song Releases of 2024 So Far (RnB & Pop Edition)</h2>
                        <h4>Read time: 10 minutes</h4>
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p> 2024 has been a year jam-packed with amazing projects, performances and more from every artist under the sun. RnB is my favourite genre of music and so I know that music will never not be good however recently I've been liking a bit of pop too (amongst other genres) and so I feel it's only right that I share some of my favorite songs this year (and there is stil more to come). Note: This is how I felt at the exact time of writing this and my rankings/song choices will most likely change after writing this because there is too much good music out right now. Okay lets get started!</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "This is my favourite song!" - <cite> Kutlwano,2024 (about every song on this list and more)</cite> 
                        </blockquote>
                        <p> <h3>Honorable Mentions:</h3><h4>Alright- Victoria Monet</h4> Technically... this song was released last year on Victoria's debut album "Jaguar 2", HOWEVER it became a single and she released a music video for it it THIS year (which was AMAZING) so I'm counting it. If it was released this year I would probably have it somewhere in the top 5 of this list but to be considerate I'm placing it here. An other-worldly collaboration with KAYTRANADA and a flawless music video to match, Victoria is just IT! She is a superstar and the Jaguar Era has been everything and more (and the deluxe is still on the way!). <h4>Butterflies- Tyla </h4> Again... this song was technically released on the teaser EP version of her debut album however this song is just too good to not include. Although song is quite different compared to the rest of her discography,that does not take away from the fact that it is immaculate!I became obssessed immediately after hearing it the first time (and still to this day) and so this song absolutely needed to be somewhere on this list (probably top 5 again if actually released this year).Tyla is such a talent and this song is a breath of fresh air!.</p>
                        <p> <h3>10) Made For Me (Soul Train Performance Live)- Muni Long </h3> This song was released last year however became an even bigger hit after her performance at the BET Soul Train Awards. Muni Long is a hitmaker. With a newly added bridge and the gospel choir in the back, this version elevated an already amazing song to new heights. I love the original version of the song and this version is even better</p>
                        <p> <h3>9) Espresso- Sabrina Carpenter </h3> As someone who watched her on Disney and listened to a few songs she released over the years, to see Sabrina blow up this year is insane! A funky-pop song with catchy lyrics and fun summer vibes, you couldn't not love this song. She is so talented and this song is definitely one of my songs of the summer.</p>
                        <p> <h3>8) the boy is mine- Ariana Grande</h3> A standout song from an already amazing album. Inspired by its predecessor by Brandy and Monica (which is an RnB classic!), Ariana's take on the song is phenomenal and she has grown to become one of my new favorite artists. I'm happy she gave this song its moment to shine as a single and including a version with Brandy and Monica is just the icing on the cake!</p>
                        <p> <h3>7) Here We Go (Uh Oh)- Coco Jones </h3> Whew, Coco Jones can do no wrong! This rich classic RnB song had me in chokehold from the strings instrumentals to Coco's beautiful voice. She's finally been getting her moment to shine and from watching her on Disney growing up I couldn't be more happy for her. If this song is on her debut album (and she's won a GRAMMY from her debut EP) then I know the rest of her songs will be even better(I can't wait!).</p>
                        <p> <h3>6) TYRANT- Beyonce</h3> Honestly I could've put any song from Cowboy Carter on this list and it would've been right because the whole album was sensational. However I chose this song in particular because there is just something so good about it that I can't even explain.It is a culmination of the country vibes on this album with a modern rnb and hiphop twist (and yes I know this song is country/hiphop and this list is meant to be pop and RnB however this is Beyonce and she deserves a place on this list regardless), and I can't believe this song isn't talked about more! Beyonce is a legend and I can never expect any less from her.</p>
                        <p> <h3>5) Jump- Tyla</h3> Yes Tyla is appearing again on this list... and rightly so! This song is infectious from the start and her first line in this song already made it an instant hit.Tyla represents South Africa (SA) proudly and excellently in everything she does and as a fellow SA girl I can't not support her! This song (and album) is 10/10 and she's only just getting started (and I can't wait for more).</p>
                        <p> <h3>4) Insomnia- Normani</h3> The album has finally arrived and was definitely worth the wait! Normani's debut album "Dopamine" is full of hits however in my opinion this song is the creme de la creme. This song is everything and I can't wait to see Normani perfom it (as well as every other song on the album) because her performances are always amazing!</p>
                        <p> <h3>3) Check- FLO</h3> FLO just keeps outdoing themselves with every song they release. This sound is a little different from their other songs but it fits them so well and the song is amazing! I'm glad that I found them through Cardboard Box and I can't wait for their debut album coming out soon!</p>
                        <p> <h3>2) BIRDS OF A FEATHER- Billie Ellish</h3> This song is just so so good!The whole album is amazing and Billie Eilish is amazing. This and WILDFLOWER tend to switch as my favourite from this album all the time but every song is really good.I can't wait to listen to more of her in the future and she deserves all the awards she gets!</p>
                        <p> <h3>1) Caught Up- FLO</h3> This is my favourite song of this year so far.FLO sound amazing on this song and this is definitely Top 5 in their discrogaphy for me.I've loved this song since my first listen (which is the case for a lot of their songs) and it is definitely an underrated hit! Defintely check out their music if you haven't already. Love them and this song!</p>

                        <h2>My Top 10 Favourite Albums-2023-2024 (So Far)- RnB & Pop Edition</h2> 
                        <h4>Read time: 5 minutes</h4>

                        <p> Over the last few years I have naturally become more of an album listener when it comes to music. If I find a new artist and like a few songs I tend to listen to their album and from there I can really appreciate their craft even more (and if I really like them I'll listen to their past projects as well). I really think that listening to albums is the best way to hear an artist's full range and you can find some hidden gems that you like or resonate with alongside the singles which are promoted out. So here is a collection of just a few albums (pop and rnb edition) that I really like which have been released over the last 2 years. Note: there probably won't be much explaining compared to my songs list but I recommend that if you need more explaination, go and listen to the album itself (trust me it will be worth it).</p>
                        <p> <h3>Honorabe Mentions:</h3><h4> What I Didn't Tell You(Deluxe)- Coco Jones</h4> Based on technicality I have to put this here as it was an EP (released in 2022) and the deluxe lenghth turned it into an album. However that takes nothing away from how amazing this project is. Coco Jones is amazing and so is this project.<h5>Song Recomendations: ICU, Double Back,No Chaser</h5><h4>Crash-Kehlani </h4> Kehlani's new project was full of experimentation with influence from across many genres.If you don't usually listen to music outside your regular scope, listen with an open mind and trsut me there will be songs you like. Also, her vocals never ever disappoint. <h5>Song Recommendations: Crash, Better Not, Next 2 U</h5></p>
                        <p> <h3>10) Gold- Cleo Sol</h3> I've only started listening to Cleo Sol for about a year but one of the best decisions I have made. Her music is so soothing and healing and helped me through rough times. Listen to all her music please! <h5> Song Recommendations:Reason,Things Will Get Better,There Will Be No Crying</h5></p>
                        <p> <h3>9) Short n' Sweet- Sabrina Carpenter</h3> Being honest I've only listened to this album once so for now I don't think I could put it higher but it is still really good so I think it should be on this list. I'm not going give any recommedations yet but these are her singles from the album (which are so good):Espresso,Taste, Please,Please,Please.</p>
                        <p> <h3>8) DOPAMINE- Normani</h3> This album definitely met my expectations. Some songs I loved on my first listen and others I grew to love the more I listened.Normani is so talented and I can't wait to see how the rest of this era plays out. <h5>Song Recommendations:Insomnia (and the rest of the album too)</h5></p>
                        <p> <h3>7) Snow Angel- Renee Rapp</h3> Again another artist I found last year and I am so glad I did. Renee can SING and this album is so so good! I can't wait until releases a RnB album because her voice is made for it!<h5>Song Recommendations:Snow Angel,Gemini Moon,Tummy Hurts</h5></p>
                        <p> <h3>6)Access All Areas- FLO</h3> Okay hear me out! I understand it's not out yet but from the 4 songs out already and everything they have put out so far I am confident that the album will be amazing! FLO's music is amazing so please listen to it all. <h5>Song Recommendations: Caught Up, Bending My Rules,Check,Walk Like This</h5></p>
                        <p> <h3>5) Eternal Sunshine- Ariana Grande</h3> This was the first new album I listened to this year and I think it set the tone for the rest of the amazing music which has come out this year.10/10! <h5>Song Recommendations: the boy is mine, we can't be friends (wait for you love), i wish i hated you</h5></p>
                        <p> <h3>4) HIT ME HARD AND SOFT- Billie Eilish</h3> I have always liked Billie's music however recently I've started listening to her more and I love her music. This album is incredible. <h5>Song Recommendations:WILDFLOWER,BIRDS OF A FEATHER,CHIHIRO </h5></p>
                        <p> <h3>3) Tyla- Tyla</h3> Tyla has only had hits so far and so I expected her album to be no different. It's probably the album I've listened the most to in 2024 and its one of my favourite debut albums ever! <h5>Song Recommendations:Butterflies,Safer,On and On,Jump</h5></p>
                        <p> <h3>2) Cowboy Carter- Beyonce</h3> It could only ever be Beyonce that could make me love a country album.The history and context that it covers,transitions and interludes and just everything= Perfect! If you haven't given this album a listen, please do it! <h5> Song Recommendations:TYRANT,DAUGHTER,YAYA,16 CARRIAGES,FLAMENCO...Just listen to the whole album.</h5></p>
                        <p> <h3>1) Jaguar 2- Victoria Monet</h3> My favourite album of 2023. Victoria is one of a kind and I'm so glad I found her music.I listened to this album so much after its release and the awards she's won from this are very much deserved!In fact listen to part 1 (which is an EP) as well as this album.Thank me later. <h5>Song Recommendations: The WHOLE ALBUM (But for now:How Does it Make You Feel,Good Bye,Hollywood,On My Mama)</h5></p>
